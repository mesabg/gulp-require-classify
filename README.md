# gulp-require-classify
Mix ng-classify with require js and using a simple sintax 

Use


define [

], () ->
	'use strict'
	# Main Application Class

	@classify
	class App extends App then constructor: -> return [
		'ngRoute'
	]

	class Main extends Controller
		constructor: ($scope) ->
			$scope.msg = 'Application has started'

	@classify


Using tag "@classify" code inside of them are going to be compiled using ng-classify plug in, no matter indentation.

Note: great solution if you are using RequireJS, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, and ng-classify plugin  



# gulp-require-classify

Mix ng-classify with require js and using a simple syntax 

## Getting Started

These is a project created to solve a problem I have when I was trying to use ng-classify plug-in and requireJS

### Prerequisites

Nothing

### Installing

Run this command

```
npm install gulp-require-classify --save-dev
```

### Use

Using tag "@classify" and "@!classify" code inside of them are going to be compiled using ng-classify plug in, no matter indentation.

```
# Main Application
define [
	
], () ->
	'use strict'
	
	@classify
	# Main Application Class
	class App extends App then constructor: -> return [
		'ngRoute'
	]

	# Main Controller Class
	class Main extends Controller
		constructor: ($scope, $location) ->
			$scope.msg = "Running"
	@!classify
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
